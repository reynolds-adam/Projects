    "# Introduction\n",
    "On April 10th, 1912, the RMS *Titanic* departed on its maiden voyage from Southhampton to New York City. After making stops in Cherbourg and Queenstown to pick up additional passengers, the ship headed towards New York. There were 2,224 passengers including 892 crew members aboard the ship. This was under the ship's capacity of around 3,300. The ship was equipped with watertight compartments that were desiged to fill up in the event of a breach to the ship's hull. This technology was said to make the ship \"unsinkable\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The *Titanic* was scheduled to arrive at New York Pier 59 on the morning of April 17th. But at around 11:40 p.m. on the night of April 14th, the ship collided with an iceberg. The ship's hull was not punctured by the collision, however it weakened the seams of the hull causing them to seperate. Several watertight compartments filled with water and the ship eventually sank in the Atlantic Ocean about 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distress signals were sent out, but no ships were near enough to reach the *Titanic* before she sank. At around 4 a.m., the the RMS *Carpathia* arrived on scene in response to the distress signals The ship had 20 lifeboats which had capacity for only 1,178 passengers. Approximately 1,500 people lost their lives in this tragic event. About 710 people survived and were taken to New York via the *Carpathia*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, who were the passengers that survived this tragedy? Fortunately, we have data which can give us insight into who survived and who perished. The goal is to use machine learning methods to identify patterns in the data to predict which passengers survived and which ones did not. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "The Titanic dataset comes from kaggle. The training set contains **891 rows and 12 columns** with one row per passenger. The test set includes 418 rows and 11 columns (the survived column is missing for the sake of the competition).\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns of the test set are:\n",
    "* **PassengerId**: Kaggle passenger id\n",
    "* **Survived**: 1 = passenger survived, 0 = passenger did not survive\n",
    "* **Pclass**: Ticket class\n",
    "* **Name**: Full name of passenger including title\n",
    "* **Sex**: Sex of passenger\n",
    "* **Age**: Age of passenger\n",
    "* **SibSp**: Number of siblings and spouses aboard the ship\n",
    "* **Parch**: Number of parents and children aboard the ship\n",
    "* **Ticket**: Ticket number\n",
    "* **Fare**: Passenger fare\n",
    "* **Cabin**: Cabin number\n",
    "* **Embarked**: Port of embarkation\n",
